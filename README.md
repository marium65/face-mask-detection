# face-mask-detection
During the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks became a crucial tool in preventing the spread of the virus. To encourage their use, many organizations and businesses implemented face mask detection systems. This project aims to develop a real-time face mask detection system that can accurately identify individuals wearing or not wearing a face mask as they pass in front of a camera.

System Design:

Hardware:
Camera: A high-resolution camera capable of capturing clear images in various lighting conditions.
Processor: A powerful processor (e.g., a Raspberry Pi or a dedicated computer) to handle image processing and machine learning tasks.
Display: An optional display to provide real-time feedback or alerts.

Software:
Programming Language: Python, due to its extensive libraries for image processing and machine learning.
Libraries:
OpenCV: For image processing, face detection, and video capture.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.
NumPy: For numerical computations.

Machine Learning Model:
Dataset: A large dataset of images with and without face masks, ideally collected from diverse sources to ensure robustness.
Model Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is well-suited for image classification tasks. 

Real-Time Detection:

Video Capture: The system continuously captures video frames from the camera.
Face Detection: OpenCV is used to detect faces in each frame.
Mask Detection: The detected faces are fed into the trained CNN, which predicts whether a mask is worn or not.
Output: The system can provide various outputs:
Displaying real-time alerts on a screen.
